1. Made the title of the website show up as well as the welcome message. The html template names in the paths on each state were spelled incorrectly.

fixed:
 homeTmpl.html
 productTmpl.html
 settingsTmpl.html


2. Links to products wasn't hooked up properly. Added a ui-sref to make sure it was hooked up to the proper state and functioning correctly.
